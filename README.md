In this work, we propose a novel Dual-Perturbation Adaptive CNN (DPA-CNN) model that integrates dual perturbation strategies and a learnable dynamic mask matrix to significantly enhance feature recognition for high-resolution NEE simulation. By fusing multisource data (meteorological parameters and vegetation indices), we achieve superior accuracy (validated by RMSE, MAE, R²) across diverse ecosystems while improving model interpretability. We further generate China's first 1 km-resolution NEE dataset (2011–2020), revealing distinct spatiotemporal carbon flux patterns and a decade-long trend of enhanced carbon sequestration. Through feature importance analysis, we identify vegetation indices (NDVI/EVI) as key drivers, bridging deep learning with ecological mechanisms.
